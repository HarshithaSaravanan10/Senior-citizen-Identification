# 🧓 Senior Citizen Detection System

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project detects **senior citizens** in real time from live video or uploaded video files using a combination of **YOLOv8** for object detection and **DeepFace** for age and gender analysis.  
It automatically determines whether a detected person is a **senior citizen (above 60 years)** and logs relevant information like **age, gender, and timestamp** into a CSV file for record-keeping.  
The system is built with a **Streamlit GUI** and uses **OpenCV** for efficient video processing.

## ⚙️ Features  
✅ Real-time **person detection** using pretrained **YOLOv8**.  
✅ Predicts **age and gender** using **DeepFace**.  
✅ Automatically classifies individuals as **Senior (age > 60)** or **Non-Senior**.  
✅ Displays detection results directly on the video feed:  
 🔴 Red boxes → Seniors  
 🟢 Green boxes → Non-seniors  
✅ Logs all detections into a CSV file (`senior_log.csv`) with **age, gender, and timestamp**.  
✅ Simple **Streamlit interface** with options for video upload or webcam feed.  
✅ Real-time OpenCV visualization with smooth performance.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

### 🧩 YOLOv8 — Person Detection  
- **Model:** Pretrained YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)  
- **Purpose:** Detect and track people in video streams with high accuracy.  
- **Advantages:** Lightweight, fast, GPU-compatible, and suitable for real-time applications.  

### 🧩 DeepFace — Age & Gender Prediction  
- **Model:** Pretrained DeepFace model  
- **Actions Used:** `['age', 'gender']`  
- **Purpose:** Estimate the age and gender of each detected face.  
- **Integration:** Cropped faces from YOLO detections are passed to DeepFace for analysis.

## 🧮 Senior Detection Logic

```python
if age > 60:
    label = f"Senior ({gender})"
    color = (0, 0, 255)  # Red box for senior
else:
    label = f"{gender}, {age} yrs"
    color = (0, 255, 0)  # Green box for non-senior
```

## 📊 Data Logging  
Detected senior citizens are recorded in a CSV file `data/senior_log.csv` with the following columns:

| Age | Gender | Time |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 67 | Male | 2025-10-27 19:45:20 |
| 72 | Female | 2025-10-27 19:46:02 |

This ensures each detection is time-stamped and traceable.
